Absolutelyâ€”letâ€™s frame this like you're briefing a highly capable AI designer to help you mock up and shape the portal interfaces for Analyst, Certifier, and Client roles. You want the prompts to be clear, direct, and purpose-driven so the output reflects your real-world dev needs. Here's how you could write each request:

---

### ðŸŽ¨ Prompt for AI Agent: Client Portal Interface Design

```
Design a responsive and modern portal page UI for a Web3-based Client in a decentralized security operations center (dSOC). The portal should include:

- Wallet connection component (MetaMask and IOTA Wallet via @iota/dapp-kit)
- Incident reporting form for both IOTA and EVM networks
- Fields for issue description, severity, category
- Evidence file upload with IPFS integration (via Pinata)
- Case tracker showing submitted cases, current status, analyst assignment
- Balance widget showing ETH and CLT token holdings
- Staking interface for prioritizing incident review
- Notifications for case updates or analyst comments

Use a clean dashboard layout, Tailwind CSS style conventions, and modular React components. Show clear role-based access control behavior.
```

### ðŸŽ¨ Prompt for AI Agent: Analyst Portal Interface Design

```
Design an interface for a Web3-based Analyst portal inside a decentralized SOC (dSOC). Portal should support:

- Analyst verification via IOTA-based VC
- Queue of incident tickets, with filtering by severity, network, and status
- Ability to claim/accept incident tickets
- Evidence file viewer (IPFS preview, SHA-256 hash verification)
- AI-powered analysis panel integrated with Google Generative AI
- Resolution submission form (notes, evidence, final analysis)
- Reward tracking widget showing earned CLT tokens and claim history

Layout must be responsive and use Tailwind CSS with modular React components. Prioritize clean, functional UX for technical users.
```

### ðŸŽ¨ Prompt for AI Agent: Certifier Portal Interface Design

```
Create a UI design for the Certifier Portal in a Web3-enabled decentralized SOC (dSOC) platform. The page should include:

- Certifier identity verification using IOTA VC
- Queue of analyst-submitted incident resolutions
- Side-by-side layout to review evidence and analysis
- Approve/Reject buttons with visual feedback
- On-chain triggers for CLT token payout to analysts
- Metrics dashboard for certifier performance, approval history, turnaround time

Follow a minimalist and professional design language using React and Tailwind CSS. Ensure role-based routing and dynamic case loading.
```

Would you like me to convert any of these into real React component skeletons next? Or generate mock images to visualize the page layouts?
